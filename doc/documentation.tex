%  Cactus Thorn template for ThornGuide documentation
%  Author: Ian Kelley
%  Date: Sun Jun 02, 2002
%  $Header$
%
%  Thorn documentation in the latex file doc/documentation.tex
%  will be included in ThornGuides built with the Cactus make system.
%  The scripts employed by the make system automatically include
%  pages about variables, parameters and scheduling parsed from the
%  relevant thorn CCL files.
%
%  This template contains guidelines which help to assure that your
%  documentation will be correctly added to ThornGuides. More
%  information is available in the Cactus UsersGuide.
%
%  Guidelines:
%   - Do not change anything before the line
%       % START CACTUS THORNGUIDE",
%     except for filling in the title, author, date, etc. fields.
%        - Each of these fields should only be on ONE line.
%        - Author names should be separated with a \\ or a comma.
%   - You can define your own macros, but they must appear after
%     the START CACTUS THORNGUIDE line, and must not redefine standard
%     latex commands.
%   - To avoid name clashes with other thorns, 'labels', 'citations',
%     'references', and 'image' names should conform to the following
%     convention:
%       ARRANGEMENT_THORN_LABEL
%     For example, an image wave.eps in the arrangement CactusWave and
%     thorn WaveToyC should be renamed to CactusWave_WaveToyC_wave.eps
%   - Graphics should only be included using the graphicx package.
%     More specifically, with the "\includegraphics" command.  Do
%     not specify any graphic file extensions in your .tex file. This
%     will allow us to create a PDF version of the ThornGuide
%     via pdflatex.
%   - References should be included with the latex "\bibitem" command.
%   - Use \begin{abstract}...\end{abstract} instead of \abstract{...}
%   - Do not use \appendix, instead include any appendices you need as
%     standard sections.
%   - For the benefit of our Perl scripts, and for future extensions,
%     please use simple latex.
%
% *======================================================================*
%
% Example of including a graphic image:
%    \begin{figure}[ht]
% 	\begin{center}
%    	   \includegraphics[width=6cm]{MyArrangement_MyThorn_MyFigure}
% 	\end{center}
% 	\caption{Illustration of this and that}
% 	\label{MyArrangement_MyThorn_MyLabel}
%    \end{figure}
%
% Example of using a label:
%   \label{MyArrangement_MyThorn_MyLabel}
%
% Example of a citation:
%    \cite{MyArrangement_MyThorn_Author99}
%
% Example of including a reference
%   \bibitem{MyArrangement_MyThorn_Author99}
%   {J. Author, {\em The Title of the Book, Journal, or periodical}, 1 (1999),
%   1--16. {\tt http://www.nowhere.com/}}

\section{Using This Thorn}

Refer to the Cactus UserGuide, Sec. B2.2, in order to know how this thorn can be used in a compiled configuration and how to possibly linking another specific version, already installed steparately.

\subsection*{Note on possible ExternalLibraries' location stripping}
\label{stripping}

Each thorn contained in \texttt{Cactus/arrangements/ExternalLibraries} will automatically adopt the library version contained in the \texttt{Cactus/arrangements/<library>/dist} folder. In particular, the tarball in \texttt{Cactus/arrangements/<library>/dist} is only used if either \texttt{THORN\_DIR} is set to \texttt{BUILD} or is left empty and no precompiled copy of the library is found. If another location is specified via the \texttt{THORN\_DIR} variable in the \texttt{<machine>.cfg} file at compilation, then the \texttt{Cactus/lib/sbin/strip-incdirs.sh} script will automatically strip away (for safety reasons) the locations:
\begin{Lentry}
\item [\texttt{/include}]
\item [\texttt{/usr/include}]
\item [\texttt{/usr/local/include}]
\end{Lentry}
from \texttt{THORN\_INC\_DIRS} which default to \texttt{THORN\_DIR/include}. Therefore, if there is any need for using one already installed version of one external library, the aforementioned location should be avoided (e.g. indicating \texttt{/home} as the \texttt{THORN\_DIR} will work with no problems if the required library is installed there) or should be carefully checked, in order to avoid unwanted stripping. The same stripping happens to \texttt{THORN\_LIB\_DIRS} in \texttt{lib/sbin/strip-libdirs.sh} with a larger list of directories:
\begin{Lentry}
\item [\texttt{/lib}]
\item [\texttt{/usr/lib}]
\item [\texttt{/usr/local/lib}]
\item [\texttt{/lib64}]
\item [\texttt{/usr/lib64}]
\item [\texttt{/usr/local/lib64}] 
\end{Lentry}

% Do not delete next line
% END CACTUS THORNGUIDE
