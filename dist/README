This tarball LORENE.tar.gz is created in the following way:

1. Check out LORENE from CVS:

   cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@octane.obspm.fr:/cvsroot checkout Lorene

2. Do not begin to build LORENE in this directory, as this would
   modify the source tree.  (It would add additional files.)

3. Create the tarball from this source tree:

   tar czf Lorene.tar.gz Lorene

4. Test whether the patches apply cleanly.  Do not add the patches to
   the tarball:

   patch -p0 < [XXX].patch

5. Remove the cvs source tree again:

   rm -rf Lorene
