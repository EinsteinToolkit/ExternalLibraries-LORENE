This tarball LORENE.tar.gz is created in the following way:

1. Check out LORENE from CVS into a directory LORENE.

2. Do not begin to build LORENE in this directory, as this would
   modify the source tree.  (It would add additional files.)

3. Create the tarball from this source tree.

4. Test whether the patches apply cleanly.
